**Customer Churn Prediction App**

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn or not based on their demographic and account details. The prediction is powered by a pre-trained TensorFlow model, and the application provides an intuitive interface for user interaction.

**Features**

**- Interactive Inputs:** Users can input customer details like geography, gender, age, balance, credit score, etc.

**- Real-time Prediction:** The app provides immediate feedback on whether the customer is likely to churn.

**- Pre-processing Pipelines:** Includes encoding (LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder) and scaling for robust predictions.

**- TensorFlow Model Integration:** Utilizes a pre-trained model.h5 for predictions.
